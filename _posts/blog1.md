When I was a kid, I hated writing. My 4th grade English class used to have us write a journal, and for me it would just be an exercise in avoiding getting chastised for my atrocious handwriting. My teacher would laugh, my peers would sympathize, and my parents would lecture, and as a result I associated writing with the unattainable, taunting, singular, stupid, annoying objective of handwriting. So from from an early age, I hated writing.

I preferred asking questions. Questions were a way to start a conversation, to learn in an exciting, vibrant way. Instead of forcing me to contemplate myself, my disorganization, my family problems, my mean friends, my identity confusion, etc. questions allowed me to focus on something completely outside of me, something new in my world. I was wholly absorbed by my questions.

I haven’t really changed since then. Though I write long papers on philosophy and literature for school, though I take great detail writing letters, emails, and even instant messages that are important for me, I very rarely write just for me. Instead I just ask questions. Though at times I come off as irritating and even invasive in my incessant pursuit of knowledge, almost like a primal desire for 21st century Oral Tradition, it is what has come to define my identity over time.

So when my mom had the idea of me writing while being here, I scoffed. I wanted to go out, meet people, and come to terms with my experiences that way, as I always had. What I realized was that living alone, and I mean really alone, makes you learn the value of just being with yourself. Questions were what brought me to India and what defined who I was, but here, alone, in a place noisier and more stressful than anywhere I had ever been, I came to realize that there was so
much inside my head that stayed there. My hatred of handwriting had barred me from asking someone questions I had never considered asking: myself.

So here I am, giving writing a try. I will write about many things, from what I see to what I learn, what I feel to what I realize, but what will remain is this: I am writing for me and no one else. Even though I may post or share these little epithets, I don’t care what other people have to say about it. I just want to let that 4th grader inside me know that he shouldn’t give a fuck about handwriting.
