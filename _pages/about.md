Here's a quick link to my [CV](https://siddsach.github.io/files/cv.pdf) and [portfolio](https://siddsach.github.io/files/portfolio.pdf). Also checkout my recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11207) applying natural language processing to evaluating cities' climate plans. 

> “The next Freud will be a data scientist. The next Marx will be a data scientist. The next Salk might very well be a data scientist.” 

-Seth Stephens-Davidowitz

Seth Stephens-Davidowitz's book,"Everybody Lies", and especially this quote, were what first got me interested in data science. I believe our society is going through a transition where humanistic issues such as equity, the value of life and nature, governance, and food systems are being dramatically reshaped by data that can help us learn how to empower people. I'm excited about applying my skills to public good issues. If you are too, then get in touch! 

## tl;dr for what I do:

* I am a data scientist in the bay area who's spent my career applying computational methods to problems I care about. I'm most proud of the AI systems I've built that empower people to scale their impact in solving social problems. 
* Systems I've built in production have analyzed pests in millions of fish using computer vision and underwater cameras, directed hundreds of thousands of messages from patients to doctors for One Medical's telemedicine system, and classified and catalogued political opinions in news articles for hundreds of college kids for a startup I founded and got funding for in college. 
* In Fall 2022, I will be starting a PhD in Environment and Resources at Stanford's [new school of sustainability](https://news.stanford.edu/2020/05/21/school-focused-climate-sustainability-will-amplify-stanfords-impact/) focusing on data science for applied sustainability problems.  I'm particularly interested in building technology, policy, and finance tools for empowering smallholder farmers. If you are too, then get in touch!


### Miscellaneous
* I have proficiency in both Hindi and Mandarin Chinese. 
* I'm an avid [world percussionist](https://youtu.be/qy-hhns3zlY?t=2919) my main instrument was Tabla, but these days I mostly jam on my [cajon](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKGypxdB_be/?taken-by=sid2968). I also write raps and freestyle sometimes, but I haven't put anything up yet.
