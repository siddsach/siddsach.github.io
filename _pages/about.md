> “The next Freud will be a data scientist. The next Marx will be a data scientist. The next Salk might very well be a data scientist.” -Seth Stephens-Davidowitz

Seth Stephens-Davidowitz's book,"Everybody Lies", and especially this quote, were what first got me interested in data science and machine learning. I believe our society is going through a transition where humanistic issues such as equity, the value of life and nature, governance, and food systems are being dramatically reshaped by algorithms that can imitate what humans do. I'm excited about applying my skills to public good issues. If you are too, then get in touch! 

## tl;dr for what I do:

* I am a data scientist in the bay area who's spent my career applying computational methods to problems that I care about. 
* Systems I've built in production have analyzed pests in millions of fish using computer vision and underwater cameras, directed hundreds of thousands of messages from patients to doctors for One Medical's telemedicine system, and classified and catalogued political opinions in news articles for hundreds of college kids for a startup I founded and got funding for in college. 
* Recently, I've been particularly interested in working on climate. Right now I'm working on a paper at the [Data-Driven Envirolab](https://datadrivenlab.org/) on computational policy analysis of the climate plans of cities.


### Miscellaneous
* I've studied, worked, and lived in India, China, Singapore, New York, and rural Massachussets. 
* I have advanced proficiency in both written and spoken Mandarin and I speak and understand Hindi. 
* I'm an avid [world percussionist](https://youtu.be/qy-hhns3zlY?t=2919) my main instrument was Tabla, but these days I mostly jam on my [cajon](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKGypxdB_be/?taken-by=sid2968). I also write raps and freestyle sometimes, but I haven't put anything up yet.
