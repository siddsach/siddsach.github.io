Here's a quick link to my [CV](https://siddsach.github.io/files/cv.pdf) and [portfolio](https://siddsach.github.io/files/portfolio.pdf). Also checkout my recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11207) applying natural language processing to evaluating cities' climate plans. 

## tl;dr for what I do:

* I am a data scientist in the bay area who's spent my career applying computational methods to problems I care about. I'm most proud of the AI systems I've built that empower people to scale their impact in solving social problems. 
* Systems I've built in production have analyzed pests in millions of fish using computer vision and underwater cameras, directed hundreds of thousands of messages from patients to doctors for One Medical's telemedicine system, and classified and catalogued political opinions in news articles for hundreds of college kids for a startup I founded and got funding for in college. 
* In Fall 2022, I will be starting a PhD at Stanford under the supervision of David Lobell focused on using new satellite data sources to empower smallholder farmers to sustainably intensify and adapt to climate change.  


### Miscellaneous
* I have advanced proficiency in both Hindi and Mandarin Chinese. 
* I'm an avid [world percussionist](https://youtu.be/qy-hhns3zlY?t=2919) my main instrument was Tabla, but these days I mostly jam on my [cajon](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKGypxdB_be/?taken-by=sid2968). I also write raps and freestyle sometimes, but I haven't put anything up yet.
